# Variable

# My name is JongPark and I am 17 years old.

name = "JongPark" # ( str )
age = 17 # ( int )

print(name) # JongPark
print(age) # 17

# Variables can be used together with basic characters.

print("Name : " + name) # Name : JongPark
print("Age : " + str(age)) # Age : 17
print("Name : " + name + ", Age : " + str(age)) # Name : JongPark, Age : 17

num1 = 10
num2 = 5

# Variables can be calculated with each other.

print(num1 + num2) # 15
print(num1 / num2) # 2.0

# Variables can be declared again.

num1 = 3
print(num1) # 3
